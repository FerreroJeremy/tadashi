# Tadashi

Tadashi is a context-aware deep decision system for smart home.

### What is it?

This project is closely modelled on the <a rel="arcades" href="https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/brenona/arcades">ARCADES</a> project of my colleague <a rel="alexis" href="https://github.com/AlexisBRENON">Alexis Brenon</a>.
I invite you to read the <a rel="hal" href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01829401">ARCADES's paper</a>.
Please cite this paper if you use Tadashi.

If you speak French and if you are really interested by his work, I recommend you to read his <a rel="thesis" href="https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01818123">thesis</a>.

### What does Tadashi mean?

> "In preparation for the Battle of Sokovia against Ultron, Tony Stark sifted through a collection of U.I. chips to select one that would replace J.A.R.V.I.S., whose matrices had been uploaded into the Vision. One chip seen was labelled "T.A.D.A.S.H.I.", however, he instead chose F.R.I.D.A.Y. [...] T.A.D.A.S.H.I. is a reference to the film Big Hero 6, where the robotic member of the titular team, Baymax, has its A.I. program stored in a chip labeled with the name of his creator, Tadashi Hamada."
